	<time datetime="2024-10-04">September 4, 2024</time>
	
    <p>Welcome to my new <strong>Engineering Hustle</strong> page. This is a page I use for learing how to develop a webpage. 
		In the future I might include a <em>technical blog about my projects</em> or cool animations.</p>
	
	<p>	Don't expect a lot from it, since it is a testing space! </p>


	<p>Various power electronic topologies exist and the selection depends on different requirements
	like:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Input voltage</li>
		<li>Output voltage</li>
		<li>Power</li>
		<li>Insulation</li>
		<li>Size</li>
		<li>EMC</li>
		<li>Efficiency</li>
		<li>Costs .</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Control of SMPS</h2>

	<p> SMPS <em>require</em> the <i>output voltage</i> to be stable. <strong>High disturbances</strong>  and 
		<strong>variations</strong> in the input voltage
		and component tolerances should be <b>compensated</b>. Therefore, the output voltage is measured and
		compensated. This feedback control needs to be designed properly, for obtaining a stable system.
		Figure 1.6 shows a buck converter with a simplified analog voltage feedback control. The output
		voltage is measured with a voltage divider Rf b<sub>1</sub> and Rf b2. It is compared to the reference voltage
		Vre f with the usage of an operational amplifier and compensated with Rcomp, Ccomp1 and Ccomp<sup>2</sup>.
		For obtaining a pulse width signal, the compensated deviation is compared to a sawtooth waveform.
		When the output of Ucomp is higher than the generated voltage GPWM, the output on Ucomp is high.
		This changes the semiconductor into the Q into the conducting state until it is turned off due to the
		Ucomp output being below the PWM generation voltage. Figure 1.4 already showed the waveforms
		for a buck converter with a fixed duty cycle. With a feedback, the duty cycle D is automatically
		adjusted to obtain a stable output voltage. An introduction on how the feedback is designed, is
		presented in a later chapter.
	</p>

	<p> In contrast to an analog controlled SMPS, digital systems use microcontroller units (MCUs), digital
		signal processors (DSPs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to control the system. The
		voltage and/or current is measured with a voltage divider and then digitized with an ADC converter. A timediscrete
		feedback controller is applied inside the digital system and a PWM is generated on the
		output. <q>If you are able to develop an analog feedback, you can do it digitally with a bit of embedded software skills.</q>
		For the digital compensation we need some code <code>Digital Compensation</code>.
